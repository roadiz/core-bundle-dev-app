## A modern CMS

_Roadiz_ is a polymorphic and headless CMS based on a node system that can handle many types of services.  
It is built on **Symfony** framework, **Doctrine ORM**, **API Platform**, and **Composer** to ensure maximum performance and security.

_Roadiz_'s node system allows you to create your data schema and organize your content exactly how you want. It is designed to remove technical constraints when building tailor-made website architectures and layouts.

Imagine you need to display your graphic design portfolio and also sell some t-shirts. With _Roadiz_, you can create custom content forms from scratch and choose the exact fields you need: images and texts for your projects, images, texts, prices, and even geolocation for your products. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called **polymorphic**.

## Philosophy

When exploring _Roadiz_'s back-office interface, you'll notice there is no Rich Text Editor (also called *WYSIWYG* editor). We chose to promote **Markdown** syntax to focus on content hierarchy and quality rather than content styling. Our goal is to preserve and respect the work of web designers and graphic designers.

_Roadiz_ is built by web designers, for web designers. It allows you to quickly create website prototypes using **Twig** templates or develop complex headless websites powered by **API Platform**.

_Roadiz_ is designed to be a great tool for both designers and developers to build strong web experiences together. But we also thought about editors! The Roadiz back-office theme, *Rozier*, offers a great writing and administration experience for all back-end users.
