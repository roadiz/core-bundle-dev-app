## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think that you have found a security issue in Roadiz or in its sub-packages, don't use the Github Issue tracker and don't publish it publicly. 
Instead, all security issues must be sent to security [at] roadiz.io. 
Emails sent to this address are forwarded to the Roadiz core team private mailing-list.
