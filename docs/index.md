Roadiz is a polymorphic CMS based on a node system that can handle many types of services.  
It is built on **Symfony** framework, **Doctrine ORM**, **API Platform**, and **Twig** to ensure maximum performance and security.

Roadiz's node system allows you to create your data schema and organize your content exactly how you want. It is designed to remove technical constraints when building tailor-made website architectures and layouts.

Imagine you need to display your graphic design portfolio and also sell some t-shirts. With Roadiz, you can create custom content forms from scratch and choose the exact fields you need: images and texts for your projects, images, texts, prices, and even geolocation for your products. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called **polymorphic**.


## Philosophy

When exploring Roadiz's back-office interface, you'll notice there is no Rich Text Editor (also called *WYSIWYG* editor). We chose to promote **Markdown** syntax to focus on content hierarchy and quality rather than content styling. Our goal is to preserve and respect the work of web designers and graphic designers.

Roadiz is built by web designers, for web designers. It allows you to quickly create website prototypes using **Twig** templates or develop complex headless websites powered by **API Platform**.

Roadiz is designed to be a great tool for both designers and developers to build strong web experiences together. But we also thought about editors! The Roadiz back-office theme, **Rozier**, offers a great writing and administration experience for all back-end users.
